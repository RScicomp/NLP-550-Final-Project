    "Pat Garrett and Brian Watson founded Six Park in 2014 while working together at their investment management firm in Melbourne, Australia. Pat and Brian met in the mid-1990s while Brian was managing the global private equity and venture capital investment unit of JP Morgan (New York), and have been working together in Melbourne since 2001. They decided they could no longer ignore a major problem in Australia's investment management industry ‚Äì namely, that it was difficult, confusing, expensive and frustrating for most Australian investors to get professional, low-cost investment advice. Worse, there was ample evidence that investors' best interests had taken a back seat to the interests of larger financial institutions. Pat and Brian met in the mid 1990's while Brian was managing the global private equity and venture capital investment unit of JP Morgan (New York), and have been working together in Melbourne, Australia since 2001. In June 2014, Pat and Brian started building a better solution for Australian investors ‚Äì a trustworthy, professionally managed, low-cost, and highly accessible investment guidance service that is not aligned with a financial institution. Six Park is now a team of seven experts, including a world-class Advisory Board, with 100+ years of experience in investment management and financial services, at organisations of the quality of JP Morgan and the Australian Government's Future Fund. The service combines innovative technology and sophisticated investment theory, and is totally transparent about its offering and fees, with the required legal authorisation to provide these services. Six Park launched in April 2016 and has grown significantly from its initial early-adopter client base. Each client has a portfolio of high-quality ASX-listed Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) developed to match their personal risk profile and investment horizon. The business has raised several rounds of private capital to build and launch its service, and has a strong pipeline of future product enhancements.

    "MarketRiders, Inc. is an easy-to use online service that allows anyone to join the Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) revolution using strategies previously only available to elite investors and large endowments like Yale and Harvard.  For $14.95 per month and 30 minutes each quarter, anyone can build and manage their own ETF portfolio and grow their money like the world's smartest investors. Traditional wisdom suggests that being successful in the stock market is about picking the right stocks or hiring the right financial advisor to manage one's money.  Study after study proves, though, that it's not possible to \"beat the market\" with any consistency, and that the most successful investors ride the market by allocating their assets across broad sections of the market and re-balancing when their asset allocations get out of whack.  While mutual funds purport to do this sort of thing, they typically charge investors 2% or more off the top, whether they're making money or not, and have tax implications that are often unfriendly to investors.  Over time, these taxes and fees can erode 30-50% of an average portfolio! MarketRiders allows investors to take control of their own money in a three step process as follows:  1. User inputs data points such as age and risk tolerance, and based on those factors, MarketRiders suggests a portfolio based on ETFs (low-fee index funds typically associated with buckets of stocks or commodities).  User can customize the portfolio or copy a successful portfolio from another MarketRiders user. 2. MarketRiders sends user a lists of trades to make at his or her online broker. Once user confirms purchases and prices, MarketRiders begins monitoring user's account for necessary changes based on rules and alerts that user can configure.  3. MarketRiders watches each user portfolio and alerts user when he or she needs to make changes.  If for example, a user wants to maintain 10% in coal, and coal makes a run such that 15% of the user's portfolio is now in coal, MarketRiders suggests the necessary trades to bring the portfolio back to the desired asset allocation.\n",

The Conatix cysana (CYberSecurity ANAlytics) insider threat detection system applies artificial intelligence to analyze everything on the screen of every employee endpoint (computer, tablet, phone) on a bank, company or government agency IT network, second by second, to stop insider fraud as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation.  Conatix cysana innovates in 3 key areas: Data, Analytics and Interface. We stream the most granular data available, everything on the screen of every endpoint on a bank IT network even with tens of thousands of employees, second by second, all text, image, video in applications and in the browser – unlike other cybersecurity systems that start with highly summarized network-level data. We solve the problem of continuous massive fast data streaming and real-time analysis, on-premise behind the bank’s own firewall.  For the interface, rather than issuing thousands of unprioritized text alerts per day to system administrators, we visualize the changing health of the IT network in 3D so both departmental and individual levels can be tracked visually.  Use case video: https://vimeo.com/163300481  Pitch video: https://vimeo.com/213777145\n",
    "\n",
    "Value.  Conatix cysana increases transparency, integrity and security in financial services, business and government.  It reduces the opportunity for moneylaundering, bribery, theft and fraud and increases visibility into the IT network to help organizations function more effectively.  cysana catches suspicious activity by users of an enterprise network that other systems will miss, and detects problems other systems will detect earlier and faster than they do, providing the highest available level of protection of proprietary, confidential and customer data based on unprecedented real-time visibility into activity on the enterprise network – affording detailed insight into the behavior and risk level of users, workgroups, departments and office locations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits.  Extremely high protection of client identifying data (CID) and other proprietary data in a bank or company, which fulfills Swiss FINMA conditions and which may limit corporate liability under GDPR.  Quick start availability as a preinstalled and preconfigured virtual appliance.  Simple and limited number of required installation steps and internet connections: No server-side installation required.  Easy rollout department by department or even device by device as required.  Plug and play: No alteration of the company server or network is required to install the client-side interceptor.  Real-time decryption of encrypted websites immediately and reliably within the browser on each individual device.  Reliable interceptor which no action by individual users can circumvent.  Automatic monitoring of each individual machine and user on a granular basis, so it is never necessary to separate out data streams from multiple machines.  Immediate foolproof traceability of captured data to the specific computer it was intercepted from.  The Conatix client-side interceptor does everything that a server-side interceptor does (fast setup, real-time warning, flexible integration with multiple data streaming and analysis systems, availability as a virtual appliance) and more, making it a value-adding enhancement to server-side or network-side interception.  If suspicious activities occur, alerts and access denial are immediate.  The system is autonomous but also integratable with existing SOC, SIEM and cyber measures.\n",

Differentiation. Conatix cysana innovates in 3 key areas: Data, Analytics and Interface. It reduces the opportunity for moneylaundering, bribery, theft and fraud and increases visibility into the IT network to help organizations function more effectively. Easy rollout department by department or even device by device as required. Immediate foolproof traceability of captured data to the specific computer it was intercepted from.'"
